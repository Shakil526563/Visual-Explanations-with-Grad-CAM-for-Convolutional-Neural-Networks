"Visual Explanations Using Grad-CAM for Convolutional Neural Networks"

Grad-CAM (Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping) was employed to provide visual explanations for convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in analyzing skin cancer images. The study revealed that VGG16 and InceptionV3 models did not deliver satisfactory visualizations. In contrast, Xception, DenseNet121, and ResNet50 models produced more effective and insightful Grad-CAM visualizations. The corresponding visualizations are presented below.
